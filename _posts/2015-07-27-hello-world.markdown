hackbeers is an awesome event for developers to drink beer, get some time away from the keyboard, and talk about your favorite language, IDE or API.

Our mission is to unite developers from all communities
===

Want to talk about Ruby, Python, Javascript, Node, Go, C#, PHP, Java, Objective-C, Scala? Come over, grab a beer, and start chatting!

Every month we’ll be at a different venue and a different date, so be sure to keep your eyes out. Follow us on Twitter, like us on Facebook or sign up to our mailing list to keep up with the beers.
